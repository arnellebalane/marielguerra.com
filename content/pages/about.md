      # Everyone's got a story to tell.<br>Here's **mine**.


      I'm Mariel, a designer and filmmaker based in Cebu, Philippines.


      I work on projects related to web and graphic design, as well as
      production design, post-production: video editing, color correction, color
      grading, and sound design.

        My story begins with silly little doodles I made stories around using a
        drawing program called Kid Pix, which eventually evolved into humble
        little school video projects.


        I took up Biology in college with the goal of becoming a doctor (I know,
        very out of character), but ended up working as a video editor after
        graduating from pre-med in 2015. I fell in love with my job and since
        then, I haven’t stopped taking courses and pursuing careers that help
        expand my skillsets as a creative.

        Working as a graphic designer, trusted to create with complete artistic
        freedom alongside other artists in Shenzhen, China, is what allowed me
        to relive my childhood passion, and it was only in 2020 that I finally
        decided to study film.

        Although COVID-19 has concluded my studies, it has not succeeded in
        stopping my pursuit of mastering the art of film.

        Fast forward to now, I’m fortunate to have opened enough doors that to
        this day, I’m still able to continue to expand my knowledge as I work
        with like-minded people who share the love I have for storytelling,
        however that may be.
